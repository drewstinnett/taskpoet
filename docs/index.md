TaskPoet is a [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) inspired task manager. We
aim to be easy to use from the CLI, but also pretty, focusing on TUI elements
from the amazing [Charm.sh](https://charm.sh/) folks.

Key reasons why this exists:

* Focus on aesthetics, even though this is a CLI app.
* Implement Tom Limoncellis Impact vs Effort chart, as a core component.
* Plugable frameworks to allow for unrelated task sources.
* It's fun to make! üòÅ
